Ruby Concepts Practice
Welcome to my Ruby concepts practice repository! This project is a collection of various Ruby programs that I've written to solidify my understanding of fundamental Ruby concepts. Below is an overview of the topics covered and a brief description of each example.

Topics Covered
Classes and Objects

Understanding the basics of classes and objects.
Creating classes, defining instance variables, and working with objects.
Method Overriding

Demonstrating how to override methods in Ruby.
Understanding the use of super to call overridden methods in parent classes.
Modules

Exploring Ruby modules and how to include them in classes.
Understanding the use of include, extend, and prepend with modules.
Caesar Cipher

Implementing a Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt text by shifting characters.
Understanding string manipulation and ASCII values in Ruby.
Bubble Sort

Implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers.
Practicing iteration and conditional statements in Ruby.
Example Programs
1. Classes and Objects
Description: This program demonstrates how to define a class, create objects, and interact with instance variables and methods.
2. Method Overriding
File: method_overriding.rb
Description: This example shows how to override a method in a subclass and use super to call the parent class method.
3. Modules
Description: This program explores the use of modules in Ruby, including mixing in modules with classes using include, extend, and prepend.
4. Caesar Cipher
Description: A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm that shifts characters in a string by a specified number of positions.
5. Bubble Sort
Description: A classic Bubble Sort algorithm implementation that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Jaydeepsolanki7/testing-ruby/
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd testing-ruby
Run any of the example programs using Ruby:
Copy code
ruby filename.rb
Conclusion
This repository serves as a practical guide for anyone looking to understand fundamental Ruby concepts through hands-on examples. Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it as a reference for your own Ruby learning journey!

Feel free to adjust this README to suit your needs or to add more details as you continue practicing Ruby.
